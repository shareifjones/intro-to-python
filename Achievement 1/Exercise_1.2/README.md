## Task 2

## Data Structure Explanation

I chose a dictionary as the data structure for recipe_1 due to its ability to map unique keys to specific data types. This makes it good for organizing structured data with labels like the ones given in the task: name, cooking_time, ingredients. It also enhances readability and allows for quick access to each part of the recipe.

## 1.3 Answer:

Using a list for all_recipes is what I chose as it allows you to store multiple recipes as individual items within the list. This makes it easy to iterate through all the recipes, add new ones, or access specific recipes by index.
