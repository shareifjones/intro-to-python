Exercise 2.3: Django Models

Learning Goals

●	Discuss Django models, the “M” part of Django’s MVT architecture
●	Create apps and models representing different parts of your web application 
●	Write and run automated tests

Reflection Questions

1.	Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are.
Django models serve as the structure for defining and interacting with your application's database.  
You define a model by specifying fields and their properties.  
Using Django's migration system, the defined models are translated into SQL statements to create or modify database tables.  
Models can also define relationships between tables.

Django has a lot of built in functionalities around validation, form generation, and serialization.  
Also, models integrate well with other Django components like the views, forms, and admin site.  
Development is faster as developers work with Python classes instead of writing raw SQL queries.

2.	In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project. You can take an example project to explain your answer.
Writing test cases from the beginning of a project is crucial for ensuring code quality, reliability, and maintainability as the project evolves.
They act like a safety net that helps developers catch errors quickly and efficiently.

For example, the Recipe app.  Making tests to check that a recipe is saved correctly is very important, like for cooking time, making sure the input is an integer and not a string.  
Adding features to the app like being able to search for a recipe by name or ID number, it’s good to have a test for to make sure the correct results display.
