Exercise 2.5: Django MVT Revisited

Learning Goals

●	Add images to the model and display them on the frontend of your application
●	Create complex views with access to the model
●	Display records with views and templates


Reflection Questions

1.	In your own words, explain Django static files and how Django handles them.

Static files are files that do not change dynamically.  
Static files can include images, CSS, JavaScript and other certain files.  
Django provides an integrated system to manage static files, both during development and production.

2.	Look up the following two Django packages on Django’s official documentation and/or other trusted sources. Write a brief description of each.


Package	Description
ListView	A class-based view that is used to display a list of objects from a model in a template.  
It automatically handles gathering the data from the database, passing it to the template context, and rendering the appropriate list view.

DetailView	Another class-based which is used to display detailed info about a single object from a model. 
The view gets the specific object from the database based on a primary key that is passed in the URL and renders it using a template.

3.	You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 2! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? You can use these notes to guide your next mentor call. 
The course is going well so far.  There is a lot of information in the readings but I am trying hard to really understand it.
I’m proud of how I’ve managed to work through implementing Django’s models, views, and templates.
I want to practice everything more but to be more specific deepening my understand on CBV and FBVs, front end integration with CSS and static files,
and just the Django way in whole.
