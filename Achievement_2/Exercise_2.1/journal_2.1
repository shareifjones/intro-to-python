Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django

Learning Goals

●	Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC
●	Summarize Django’s benefits and drawbacks 
●	Install and get started with Django

Reflection Questions

1.	Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?
Advantages Django:
	Its rapid development, scalability and security.  
    It offers extensive documentation and a reliable community.  
    The use of DRY principle which keep the code clean and non-redundant.
Drawbacks Django:
	Beginners using Django might find it overwhelming at first.  
    For smaller projects, Django might feel excessive, and it is less flexible when it comes to the Django way.


Advantages Python:
	You can have full control over its architecture and implementation.  
    It helps developers understand web development fundamentals, such as HTTP requests, routing, and handling responses.
Drawbacks Python:
	Building everything from scratch takes a lot more time.  
    The lack of built in features, which mean the developer would have to manually implement them all.  
    When it comes to scalability without a framework, it leads to disorganized code and performance issues.

2.	In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?
The most significant advantage to using MVT over MVC is its simplicity and integration of templates into the framework.  
The Template component directly handles the presentation logic, eliminating the need for a separate Controller.  
It reduces the developer’s workload and makes it easier to maintain.

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
●	What do you want to learn about Django? 
I would like to learn about its’ core features and gain a deep understanding about them.
●	What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
I want to build a fully function web application that incorporates user authentication, database integration, and client-side rendering.
●	Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
After completing this Achievement, I envision myself working on team-based projects, utilizing Django, Python, HTML, and CSS.
