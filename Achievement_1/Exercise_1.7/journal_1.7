Exercise 1.7: Finalizing Your Python Program
Learning Goals

●	Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper
●	Build your final command-line Recipe application


Reflection Questions

1.	What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?
Instead of writing raw SQL queries, developers use methods and classes to perform database operations. 
The ORM translates the code into SQL queries behind the scenes and maps database tables to classes and rows to objects.
Advantages:
ORMs makes life easier for developers, allowing developers to work with Python objects instead of writing and maintaining raw SQL queries.
Faster development process as developers can perform CRUD operations using straightforward method calls.

2.	By this point, you’ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What’s something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what’s something about your app that you would change or improve?
The process of creating the Recipe app was challenging but also rewarding.  
I feel with more practice I can solidify my understanding and be able to apply the concepts easier.  
I believe I did a good job in organizing my code and making sure the flow of it makes sense.  
If I were to do it again, I would include more checks to improve user experience, add more detailed error messages, and make the searches more complex.

3.	Imagine you’re at a job interview. You’re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question.
In my recent project, I developed a Recipe Management app using Python, which allows users to create, search, update, and delete recipes stored in a database. 
This project involved designing a fully functional command-line application while leveraging SQLAlchemy as an Object Relational Mapper.  
I’m proud of the app because it combines fundamental concepts of programming with practical database management. 
If given the opportunity, I’m eager to build more complex applications and contribute these skills to your team.
