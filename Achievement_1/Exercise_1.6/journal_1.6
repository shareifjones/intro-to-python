Exercise 1.6: Connecting to Databases in Python

Learning Goals

●	Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

Reflection Questions

1.	What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?
A database is an organized collection of data stored electronically, and they are managed using Database Management Systems. 
They store information in tables or other structures like collections and allow users or applications to retrieve, modify, or manipulate the data efficiently.

Advantages:
	Databases allow for systematic and efficient storage, retrieval, and management of large amounts of data, reducing redundancy and duplication.
	Databases are designed to handle large-scale data efficiently and can grow as the application or organization’s needs expand.	
Data can be accessed and queried using standard languages like SQL, making it easier to retrieve specific information quickly.
2.	List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:


Data type	Definition
INT(integer)	Used to store whole numbers
VARCHAR	Used for storing variable-length text data.
DATE	Used to store date values in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

3.	 In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?
SQLite would be a better choice than MySQL when it comes to small-scale applications.  
Another situation would be when an application being built will only have one or very few users access the database at the same time.  
In summary, SQLite is best for smaller, simpler applications or scenarios that are portable, easy to use, and have minimal setup.

4.	Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?
JavaScript:
	Primarily used for front end development.
	Syntax is more complex and requires attention to details.
	Runs natively in web browsers.
Python:
	A general-purpose language used in diverse fields.
	Syntax is simpler and easier to read.
	Typically runs on servers or as standalone scripts.

5.	Now that you’re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?
Python is not a native choice for mobile app development.
Python is a slower language.
Python cannot run natively in web browsers, unlike JavaScript.
