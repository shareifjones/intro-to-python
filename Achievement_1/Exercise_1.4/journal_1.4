Exercise 1.4: File Handling in Python
Learning Goals

●	Use files to store and retrieve data in Python

Reflection Questions

1.	Why is file storage important when you’re using Python? What would happen if you didn’t store local files?
File storage allows data to persist beyond the duration of a program's execution.  
Storing data in files makes it easier to share information between different parts of a program, other applications, or even other users.

Any unsaved data generated during a program session would be lost once the session ends. 
Users would have to input data repeatedly with each session, leading to a poor user experience.


2.	In this Exercise you learned about the pickling process with the pickle.dump() method. What are pickles? In which situations would you choose to use pickles and why? 

Pickles convert complex data into a packaged stream of bytes, then write this into a binary file.  
When the pickles are read, they’re converted back into the original object that had been stored in the file. 
Pickles are useful when you need to store complex data structures like lists or dictionaries.  
Pickled data maintains its original Python structure, making it easy to reload into a Python environment.

3.	In Python, what function do you use to find out which directory you’re currently in? What if you wanted to change your current working directory?

Os.getcwd() is used to find out which directory you’re currently in.
Os.chdir() is used to change your current working directory.

4.	Imagine you’re working on a Python script and are worried there may be an error in a block of code. How would you approach the situation to prevent the entire script from terminating due to an error?

I would try to identify the potential problem areas in my code.
Then I would use the try-except block where “try” is where you would involve the code that you expect an error to occur.  
Also using an “except” block to handle general or specific errors.

5.	You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 1! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? Feel free to use these notes to guide your next mentor call. 
I’d say that I need to spend more time on the concepts to make sure I really understand them and can apply them.  
I also would say I need to find resources where I can practice everything I learned over and over again until it really sticks.
